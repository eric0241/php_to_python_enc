<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This repository's goal is to follow along with <a href="https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/prog/3/">HackThisSite's Programming Level 3</a>.</p>
<p>The mission asks to reverse an encryption algorithim written in PHP. Since my PHP is a tad bit rusty, I figured it would be a fun exercise to rebuild the encryption algorithim using Python. So far I have managed to get a functional Python script, named "enc_code.py", that has the same behavior as the PHP code.</p>
<p>I'm beginning to work on the actual reverse engineering portion, but feel free to check out the existing code base! It was pretty daunting at first. I thought I had a good grasp on hexadecimal stuff, but was faced with a very challenging, but rewarding, task of translating the code.</p>
